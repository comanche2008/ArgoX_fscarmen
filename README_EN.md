<br>

>2024.12.24 v1.6.6 Refactored the chatGPT detection method based on lmc999's detection and unlocking script

>2024.5.20 v1.6.5 1. Add Github CDN; 2. Remove subscription template 2

>2024.3.26 v1.6.4 Thanks to UUb for the official change of the compilation, dependencies jq, qrencode from apt installation to download the binary file, reduce the installation time of about 15 seconds, the implementation of the project's positioning of lightweight, as far as possible to install the least system dependencies

>2024.3.24 v1.6.3 1. Compatible with CentOS 7,8,9; 2. Remove default Github CDN

>2024.3.13 v1.6.2 1. Subscription made optional, no nginx and qrcode installed if not needed; 2. Use native IP if it supports unlocking chatGPT, otherwise use warp chained proxy unlocking

>2024.3.10 v1.6.1 1. To protect node data security, use fake information to fetch subscribe api; 2. Adaptive the above clients. https://\<argo tunnel url\>/\<uuid\>/\<auto | auto2\>

>2024.3.2 v1.6 1. Support V2rayN / Nekobox / Clash / sing-box / Shadowrocket subscribe. https://\<argo tunnel url\>/\<uuid\>/\<base64 | clash | sing-box-pc | sing-box-phone | proxies | qr\>. Index of all subscribes: https://\<argo tunnel url\>/\<uuid\>/  ; Reinstall is required; 2. Adaptive the above clients. https://\<argo tunnel url\>/\<uuid\>/\<auto | auto2\>

>2023.2.16 beta1 Argo + Xray for vps
</details>

## Project Features:

* Deploy Xray in VPS, using the scheme Argo + Xray + Reality / Argo + Xray + WebSocket + TLS;
* Normally CF backhauls from data centers, Argo creates two reverse links to two nearby data centers, and backhauls from the source server through the nearby data centers. The line between the user's data center and the source server's nearby data center is CF's proprietary black box line;
* Using CloudFlare's Argo Tunnel with TLS encrypted communication, application traffic can be securely transmitted to the Cloudflare network, improving application security and reliability. In addition, Argo Tunnel can also prevent network threats such as IP leaks and DDoS attacks;
* Argo is an intranet tunnel, meaning Xray's inbound does not expose ports externally, increasing security, and does not require camouflage websites that waste resources. It also supports all Cloudflare ports, not just port 443 which can be blocked. At the same time, the server outputs Argo Ws data streams, greatly simplifying data processing and improving response. TLS is provided by CF, avoiding multiple TLS;
* Argo Tunnel supports both temporary tunnels and fixed domain names through Token or cloudflared Cli methods. Direct optimization + tunnel does not require domain certificates and can be converted at any time after installation;
* Supports Xray's direct connection protocols: reality vision and reality gRPC; as well as ws fallback traffic splitting for 4 mainstream protocols: vless / vmess / trojan / shadowsocks + WSS (ws + tls);
* Built-in warp chained proxy to unlock chatGPT;
* Node information output to V2rayN / Clash Meta / Shadowrocket / Nekobox / Sing-box (SFI, SFA, SFM), subscription automatically adapts to clients, one subscription url for everything;
* Ultra-fast installation, either interactive or non-interactive like docker compose. Put all parameters in a configuration file in advance, taking less than 5 seconds.

## Obtaining Argo Json

Users can easily obtain it through the Cloudflare Json generation website: https://fscarmen.cloudflare.now.cc

If you want to do it manually, you can refer to the commands needed for Debian as an example, [Deron Cheng - CloudFlare Argo Tunnel Trial](https://zhengweidong.com/try-cloudflare-argo-tunnel)

## Description of Xray outbound and routing templates in various scenarios

* Domain classifications containing specific domains: https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community/blob/master/data
* Routing instructions: https://www.v2fly.org/config/routing.html
* Modify `/etc/argox/outbound.json`. Note: Please backup the original `outbound.json` file first. Check the format of the modified json at https://www.json.cn/
* After modification, run `systemctl restart xray; sleep 1; systemctl is-active xray`. If it shows active, it's effective. If it shows failed, check the configuration file format.

| Description | Template Example |
| --- | ------ |
| chatGPT uses chained warp proxy, no need to install warp locally, other traffic goes through vps default network exit | [warp](https://gitlab.com/fscarmen/warp#通过-warp-解锁-chatgpt-的方法) |
| Specified traffic goes through the specified network interface on the local machine, for dual-stack IPv4 or IPv6 differentiation, other traffic goes through vps default network exit | [interface](https://gitlab.com/fscarmen/warp#指定网站分流到-interface-的-xray-配置模板适用于-warp-client-warp-和-warp-warp-go-非全局) |
| Specified traffic goes through the specified socks5 proxy on the local machine, for dual-stack IPv4 or IPv6 differentiation, other traffic goes through vps default network exit | [socks5](https://gitlab.com/fscarmen/warp#指定网站分流到-socks5-的-xray-配置模板-适用于-warp-client-proxy-和-wireproxy) |
